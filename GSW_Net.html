      Nowadays, with the development of sensor technology, acquiring image data has become easier and more efficient.
      However, the growing number of image has made fast and accurate image matching become a huge bottleneck in terms of the time efficiency of SfM.
      <br><br>
      To break through the bottleneck, we can employ methods such as Bag-of-Words (BoW) trees or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
      But there still exists some limitations when it comes to the methods above: On the one hand, due to the lack of the standard referenced overlapping relationship, 
      the evalutaion of a method usually relies on the quality of SfM orientation result. It is obviously not rigorous enough. On the other hand, 
      Methods like VGG or ResNet are commonly trained on ImageNet which actually brings train data bias and task bias issues, making it difficult to transfer them to the task of determining overlapping image pairs.
      <br><br>
      Therefore, in order to solve the problems, our project aims to create a standardized dataset with labeled overlapping image pairs based on the traditional photogrammetric procedures.
      <br><br>
      Otherwise, this project is a part of the project which is shown below, which aims to get a more efficient and suitable algorithm for overlapping image pairs retrievel.

      The overall pipeline to automatically generate BeDOI is illustrated in the figure below, 
      in which pre-processing is for obtaining 3D mesh model and image orientation parameters, 
      and automatic annotation is for estimating referenced overlapping relationships:

      Our experiment aims to test commonly used image matching or feature extracting methods. And here is the process:
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Extract feature descriptors by a certain method.</li>
        <li>Randomly sample 100 images and compute their similarity with all images.(We have already finished this step, the sample images' name have been provided below)</li>
        <li>Extract the Top-N most similar images for each image based on the similarity, and sort them.</li>
        <li>Calculate precision and recall for each algorithm at different N values by comparing with the result provided by BeDOI.</li>
      </ul>
